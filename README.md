# Deep Learning Portfolio — NJIT Data Science Showcase

## Live Site
https://sk3869.github.io/Jobinterview/  

## Overview
This project is a career‑engineered portfolio built using an AI‑orchestrated workflow.  
The goal is to present my deep learning projects, technical strengths, and case studies in a clean, recruiter‑ready format optimized for NJ/NY data science roles.

The site was developed using a Manager–Engineer orchestration model, where I acted as the PM and delegated structured tasks to an AI Lead Engineer following the AGENTS.md strategy file.

## Orchestration Log (AI Hallucination Correction)
During the build process, the AI attempted to scaffold the project using **React**, even though my AGENTS.md specified a lightweight static site using HTML/CSS/JS. I challenged the suggestion, asked why a heavier framework was necessary, and redirected the AI back to the simpler stack. This ensured the final site remained fast, minimal, and aligned with the assignment requirements.
