1. What is your exact career outcome?
I want to become a Data Scientist specializing in Deep Learning, ideally working on computer vision or medical imaging models in the NJ/NY tech ecosystem.


2. Who is your target audience?
My primary audience is data science recruiters and hiring managers at AI‑focused companies. Secondary audience includes research labs, healthcare AI startups, and teams working on applied machine learning.


3. What technical skills do you already have?
I’m comfortable with Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit‑learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. I also know basic SQL and have experience training CNNs and LSTMs for class projects.


Disagreement : Why React for a simple portfolio?
Isn’t that overkill for a static site?
Is there a lighter, faster option we can deploy without unnecessary complexity?


Since my goal is to become a Deep Learning Data Scientist, not a front‑end engineer, I’d prefer something minimal like HTML/CSS/JS unless there’s a strong strategic reason to use something heavier.




4. What “proof” do you have?
I have three strong projects:


A CNN that classifies brain MRI images


A sentiment analysis model using LSTMs


A Kaggle project where I built a tabular classifier with feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning


All of them are on GitHub.


5. Which project are you MOST proud of, and why?
The MRI classifier — because it pushed me into real deep learning workflows like data augmentation, transfer learning, and evaluating model drift. It also aligns with healthcare AI, which I’m interested in.


6. What industries interest you?
Healthcare AI, fintech analytics, and any company doing applied deep learning for imaging or NLP.


7. How comfortable are you with front-end tools like HTML/CSS/JS?
I’m comfortable with basic HTML/CSS and can build a clean static site. I’m not trying to build anything complex — just something professional and fast.


8. Do you want your site to feel more:
Technical and developer‑focused. I want it to look like a portfolio for someone serious about machine learning.


9. What is the ONE action you want visitors to take?
Download my technical resume or view my GitHub deep learning projects.


10. What is your timeline?
I want something clean and functional quickly — I can always expand it later.
