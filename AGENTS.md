# AGENTS.md — Master Implementation Letter

## The Mandate
Create a portfolio that positions me as a strong candidate for a Junior Front-End Developer role in NYC’s fintech sector. The site must quickly communicate my technical ability, highlight real project work, and guide recruiters toward a clear next step.

## The Tech Stack (and Why)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**  
  Simple, fast, and ideal for a clean static portfolio without backend complexity.
- **Tailwind CSS**  
  Speeds up styling, ensures mobile responsiveness, and supports modern UI patterns used in fintech.
- **GitHub Pages**  
  Free hosting with instant deployment and direct integration with my GitHub activity.
- **VS Code with Copilot**  
  Allows rapid scaffolding, AI-assisted coding, and structured agentic workflows.

## The Sitemap
1. **Hero Section**  
   - Name, role, and a concise value statement tailored to fintech  
   - Strong CTA button (e.g., “Request My Technical Resume”)

2. **Case Studies Section**  
   - Two or three project write-ups relevant to front-end or fintech  
   - Each includes: the problem, my approach, tools used, and measurable results  
   - Links to GitHub repositories

3. **Lead-Gen / CTA Section**  
   - Primary CTA: “Request My Technical Resume”  
   - Secondary option: “View My GitHub Contributions”  
   - Simple form or button linking to email or scheduling

4. **Footer**  
   - GitHub, LinkedIn, Email  
   - NJ/NY location tag

## Non-Negotiables
- **Mobile-responsive design** across all devices  
- **SEO keywords optimized for NJ/NY tech hiring**, including:  
  “NJIT,” “NYC fintech,” “Junior Front-End Developer,” “React developer NJ,” “Newark software engineer”  
- **A single, clear CTA** repeated throughout the site  
- **Fast load times** with minimal scripts and no unnecessary libraries
